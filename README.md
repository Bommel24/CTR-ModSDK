## üìä Progress
### Research and Decompilation

Decompiling the assembly assisted by Ghidra, researching how it works and adding comments for guidelines.

### Code Rewrite

Rewriting Ghidra output to human-readable C Code and testing if it matches.
Most of the source code are shared between versions.
