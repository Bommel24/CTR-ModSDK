Supports all builds

Right now this is on Parking Lot, and 1P, to test that everything works.
In the future, you'll go through main menu, pick characters, pick map,
and load into gameplay like that. Each map should have it's own list
of items scattered around. Need to optimize collisions to use BSPs just
like level instances, still working on that
