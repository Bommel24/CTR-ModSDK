Recommended to play with 60fps patches,
after patching your rom, must make a hex change:
search 80 1f 11 3c d4 03 31 36
replace 00 80 11 3c 00 c0 31 36

Must have DuckStation open with the game running,
and Quest 2 running in "Quest Link" mode, before
startin this windows program

After running the mod, and entering the DuckStation PID,
put on the headset, you should see "Oculus Test" appear.
Press the Oculus Home button on your right hand, then 
with your Quest Link taskbar, select view desktop monitor.
Press L2 to make the monitor centered to your view in Quest Link
Press Select to center the headset view in CTR itself

You can not "lock" the quest link monitor to your head,
so turning around 180 degrees will make you not see anything.
We just need to wait for Oculus to implement the feature "eventually".
You can view several degrees left, right, up, and down though.

Do NOT attempt this in the $19.99 app Virtual Desktop, while
that does have a desireable "lock to head" option, the VR mod
can not connect to the headset, cause you are not in Quest Link
if you are running that app.
