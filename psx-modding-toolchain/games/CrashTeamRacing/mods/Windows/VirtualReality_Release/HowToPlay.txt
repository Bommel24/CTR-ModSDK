Notice: If the game crashes for any reason,
dont restart the emulator, use the DuckStation "Reset" button.
If your view is un-centered, press Select on your PS1 controller
to re-center your view (which is whatever you configured in
DuckStation Controller Settings) 

Step 1/10:
Apply ctr-u_60fps_VR.xdelta to CTR USA rom (in .bin format)
Recommended to use the following patcher:
https://hack64.net/tools/patcher.php

Step 2/10: 
Drag all files from geo-11 folder into DuckStation directory,
so the files are next to the DuckStation exe file

Step 3/10:
Open DuckStation
Go to Settings -> Console Settings, check "Enable Clock Speed Control", slide to 400%
Go to Settings -> Display Settings, choose Renderer D3D11
Go to Settings -> Enhancement Settings, Resolution Scale, choose any high resolution

Step 4/10:
In DuckStation, choose Start File, and boot the modified CTR rom (.bin)
If you see black screens after "Sony Presents", dont worry, it's normal.
Also the top/bottom dispaly on your monitor is normal.

Step 5/10:
When the game reaches the main menu, choose a game mode,
this prevents the game from playing a cutscene while
you turn on the headset

Step 6/10:
Turn on Oculus Quest, go into Oculus Link mode,
then take headset off

Step 7/10:
Start OculusTest.exe, pick a number (1, 2, or 3).
3rd-person is the least motion-sickening of all options.
1st-person (kart head) will rotate the camera based on
the head rotation of the kart character, hitting a potion
will make your head spin in circles, potentially sickening.
1st-person (velocity) will rotate the camera based on
the direction the kart is moving in, not sickening.
Both first-person modes have been hidden in CTR since 
the game shipped, they were both designed by Naughty Dog.

Step 8/10:
After picking mode, enter DuckStation PID
You can get PID from windows task manager.
After entering PID, dont close the window, you can minimize though

Step 9/10:
Start vr-screen-cap-CTR.exe

Step 10/10:
Put on the headset, center your head, and press 
PS1 Select button on your controller to calibrate,
then put on some headphones cause there's no audio 
streaming to the headset through VrScreenCap yet.

Enjoy the game!
