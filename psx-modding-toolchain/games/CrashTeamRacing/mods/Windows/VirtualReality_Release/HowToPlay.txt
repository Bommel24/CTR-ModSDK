Notice: If the game crashes for any reason,
dont restart the emulator, use the DuckStation "Reset" button.
If your view is un-centered, press Select on your PS1 controller
to re-center your view (which is whatever you configured in
DuckStation Controller Settings) 

Step 1/10:
Apply ctr-u_60fps_VR.xdelta to CTR USA rom (in .bin format)
Recommended to use the following patcher:

Step 2/10: 
Drag all files from geo-11 folder into DuckStation directory,
so the files are next to the DuckStation exe file

Step 3/10:
Open DuckStation, and boot the modified CTR rom (in .bin format)
If you see black screens after "Sony Presents", dont worry, it's normal.
Also the top/bottom dispaly on your monitor is normal.

Step 4/10:
Turn on Oculus Quest, go into Oculus Link mode,
then take headset off

Step 5/10:
Start OculusTest.exe, pick a number (1, 2, or 3).
3rd-person is the least motion-sickening of all options.
1st-person (kart head) will rotate the camera based on
the head rotation of the kart character, hitting a potion
will make your head spin in circles, potentially sickening.
1st-person (velocity) will rotate the camera based on
the direction the kart is moving in, not sickening.
Both first-person modes have been hidden in CTR since 
the game shipped, they were both designed by Naughty Dog.

Step 6/10:
After picking mode, enter DuckStation PID
You can get PID from windows task manager.
After entering PID, dont close the window, you can minimize though

Step 7/10:
Start vr-screen-cap-CTR.exe

Step 8/10:
Put on the headset, center your head, and press 
PS1 Select button on your controller to calibrate

Step 9/10:
Put on some headphones, cause there's no audio support in headset yet

Step 10/10:
Play the game!
